The above link provides watch-on-demand videos for LLM (Large Language Model) Bootcamps.

During the two days of the conference, I got an understanding of what we can do with the recent developments from working on Python code along with database views and showcasing the output using Streamlit functionality.

Different quick-start guides are shown below:
