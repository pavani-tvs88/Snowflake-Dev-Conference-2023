# Snowflake-Dev-Conference-2023

I am highlighting a few of the information that I found interesting when I attended the Snowflake Dev Conference.
You can find the below link which will give you more information:

The above link provides watch-on-demand videos for LLM (Large Language Model) Bootcamps.

During the two days of the conference, I got an understanding of what we can do with the recent developments from working on Python code along with database views and showcasing the output using Streamlit functionality.

Different quick-start guides are shown below:

A few definitions and reference pages included have other definitions for references:


Streamlit: Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. By using Streamlit you can quickly build and deploy powerful data applications. For more information about the open-source library, see the Streamlit Library documentation.

SnowPark ML: Snowpark ML is a set of tools, including SDKs and underlying infrastructure, for building and deploying machine learning models. With Snowpark ML, you can pre-process data and train, manage, and deploy ML models all within Snowflake. You benefit from Snowflakeâ€™s proven performance, scalability, stability, and governance at every stage of the machine-learning workflow.

Day 1
We had interesting discussions on various topics. The lab I attended gave me a perspective into connecting Snowpark for Python which is part of the snowflake.

We have worked on the labs using the quickstart guide to understand how it can be done: https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/data_engineering_with_snowpark_python_intro/index.html#0

Day 2
I attended the Microsoft Azure and Snowflake collaboration team sessions, the LLM (Large Language Models) Innovators showcase (this session showcased the projects created using Streamlit, snowpark, and LLM), and a few more.

Microsoft Open AI and Snowflake can be integrated into four different models.

Below is a quick-start guide for Microsoft Open AI and Snowflake:
